# secret-bookshelf_digital-systems-project
This project was from ECE 350 (digital systems) at Duke University, split into two parts: first, creating a 32-bit 5-stage pipelined CPU with stalling and bypassing in Verilog, and then running that processor on a physical FPGA for a final project. Me and my partner used our processor to build a secret bookshelf.
